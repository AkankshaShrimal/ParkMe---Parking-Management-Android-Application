## Project Overview

This project is done as a part of `Mobile Computing Course` Course.

We developed a parking mangament app : ParkME to solve following problems related to parking space management. 
- Vehicles parked in a haphazard manner, making it difficult to use parking space efficiently.
- Two wheelers packed in four-wheeler space.
- Vehicles parked in no-parking spaces.
- Vehicles parked in otherâ€™s parking spaces.
- Looking for empty parking spaces. 
  
Our app will provide a common solution to all these problems by enabling user to :- 
- Communicate with wrongly parked vehicle owners and ask to repark. 
- Send push notifications 
- Chat instantly, if required
- Penalise officials or locals by society or corporation.
- Look for empty parking spaces around.
