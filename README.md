## Project Overview

This project is done as a part of `Mobile Computing Course` Course.

We developed a parking mangament app : ParkME to solve following problems related to parking space management. 
- Vehicles parked in a haphazard manner, making it difficult to use parking space efficiently.
- Two wheelers packed in four-wheeler space.
- Vehicles parked in no-parking spaces.
- Vehicles parked in otherâ€™s parking spaces.
- Looking for empty parking spaces. 
  
Our app will provide a common solution to all these problems by enabling user to :- 
- Communicate with wrongly parked vehicle owners and ask to repark. 
- Send push notifications 
- Chat instantly, if required
- Penalise officials or locals by society or corporation.
- Look for empty parking spaces around.

## Functionalities
- RAISE QUERY
    User will be able to raise a query to the intended user, by capturing the vehicle number and
    ML model will detect the text on the number plate. User specifies the reason, parking space
    and query type and query is automatically raised to the respective user. If no such user with
    the same number plate is registered with the society, the query is directly raised to admin.
- PUSH NOTIFICATION
    Once a query is raised, a push notification is sent to the intended user with all other details.
    On clicking the push notification, the user can see all the details and even chat with other
    users.
- CHAT FUNCTIONALITY
    A chat interface between two users.
- ANNOUNCEMENTS
    A message can be delivered to all users using the particular app.
- QUERY RESOLVING
    The user can look into queries raised by him or queries raised to him. He can even resolve
    the query when the work is done.
- USER RATING
    On resolving the queries, users will be asked to rate the other users and a rating will be
    displayed for each and every user over the interface. This rating can then be used by the
    society to reward/penalize the users.
- FIND SLOTS
    Our application also provides flexibility to search empty parking spaces available in the
    society.
- LOGIN
    A login functionality with all checks.
- FORGOT PASSWORD
    Forgot password functionality.
- CHANGE PASSWORD
    change password functionality.
- VIEW QUERY AND CHATS
    Users can view all queries raised by him/to him along with all the chats.
- PROFILE AND SETTING
    A profile and settings page. Admin can be contacted through the settings page.
- LOGOUT
    A logout functionality.
